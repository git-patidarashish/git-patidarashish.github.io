              <h4>Covid Glossary Analysis on a Tableau Dashboard</h4>
              <p>This project aimed to create a Tableau dashboard for analyzing and visualizing news content from various media outlets, including audio, video, and articles. 
                Its primary objective was to identify trends in COVID-related news over a three-year period and determine if the media played a role in spreading any misconceptions about the pandemic.
                Different types of visualizations including geospatial, topical, and temopral were performed for the analysis. <br>

              <h4>Polarization of Democrats and Republics</h4>
              <p>This project aimed to analyze the trends in political ideologies within the United States and evaluate if the nation was undergoing escalating polarization, resulting in a lack of representation in the moderate section of the political spectrum. 
                To expedite the analysis process, techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) will be employed. 
                These methods help in reducing data dimensions and visualizing the ideological landscape more efficiently.

              <h4>Analysis of Life Expectancy and GDP Over the Years</h4>
              <p>The purpose of this mini project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the changes in GDP and life expectancy rates across the five continental regions: Asia, Africa, Americas, Europe, and Oceania. 
                Additionally, the project aimed to establish a relationship between GDP and life expectancy and determine if this relationship could be explained through a simple model.
                Statistical inferences were made with the help of residual plots, homoscedasticity plots, and QQ plots.

                This project was undertaken as part of the Crossroads Classics Analytics Challenge, where our team achieved the runners-up position. 
                The analysis involved employing boosting algorithms, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), performing feature engineering, and fine-tuning hyperparameters on a dataset containing over a million rows and 32 columns of data.

                Additionally, the project aimed to identify the combination of these features that could provide the most accurate predictions. 
                To achieve this, a multinomial logistic model was utilized for making predictions and drawing insights from the data.

              <p>This project provided me with an initial exposure to audio files and various ways of representing transcripts. 
                Its main goal was to synchronize audio clips of the Puebla Nahuatl language with their time-annotated transcripts, which included dependency trees. 
                This alignment process involved utilizing different metadata features and transcript tokens. 
                However, when it comes to other languages, it would be more feasible to develop a new model and generate time-annotated dependency trees. 
                Unfortunately, for Nahuatl, there is insufficient data available to create an accurate model.

              <h4>Distributed MapReduce for Text Recognition</h4>
              <p>The concept behind this project involved harnessing the untapped resources of machines connected within the same network to conduct distributed computing for a substantial problem. 
                Our team effectively implemented this model for numerous tasks and achieved results that were comparable to Apache-Spark, particularly for the OCR task. 
                Both cloud machines on Jetstream and local machines were utilized in this project.

              <h4>Bayesian Linear Regression with Uninformative Priors</h4>
              <p>For this project, Bayesian linear regression was employed to forecast the apparent temperature in Szeged, Hungary. 
                The data underwent analysis to identify significant features and determine whether incorporating interactions between these variables would be advantageous for constructing the model.
                Both default priors and Zellner-g priors were utilized to compare and establish the framework for the model.

              <h4>Tweets Sentiment Analysis in R</h4>
              <p>The motivation behind this project was my desire to delve into the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
                A simple model was constructed to tally the occurrences of positive, negative, and neutral words in a tweet. Based on these probabilities, an attempt was made to classify the tweets into one of the three categories. 
                To accomplish this, the Twitter developer API was utilized in R to establish a connection with Twitter and extract tweets from any publicly available profile on the platform.

                The web application was robust and was able to handle concurrent transactions with complete security.
